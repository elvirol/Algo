Implement a Queue Using Two Stacks
Create a class that implements a Queue using two Stacks. The queue should support the following operations:

enqueue(value) - Adds an element to the queue.

dequeue() - Removes and returns the front element of the queue.

peek() - Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.

isEmpty() - Checks if the queue is empty.

Use two stacks (inStack and outStack) to implement these operations.
