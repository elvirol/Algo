Create an object library that stores information about books. Each book should have the following properties:

title: The title of the book.

author: The author of the book.

year: The year the book was published.

genre: The genre of the book (for example: "fiction", "mystery", etc.).

isAvailable: A boolean indicating if the book is available or checked out.

Add a method called getBookSummary to the object. This method should return a string summarizing the bookâ€™s title, author, and year.

Add a method called checkOut that changes the isAvailable property to false (indicating that the book is checked out).

Add a method called returnBook that changes the isAvailable property to true (indicating the book has been returned).

Add a method called getAvailableBooks which takes an array of books (i.e. an array of library objects) and returns an array of all books that are available (i.e. isAvailable: true).
